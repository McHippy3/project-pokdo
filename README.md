# Project Pokdo

Live Link: 

Case Exercise: Design a dynamic listing website (a very basic version of Kijiji/Craigslist). Host the data-store in the cloud somewhere (e.g., database like Postgres, image upload to S3). Can use any language, but our team has a preference for Javascript (our stack is React and Node.js). Please share Github code and title the project ("Project POKDO"), and the live link during submission. Further details below:
Dynamic listings site:

- Ability for a user to hit a ‘Create’ button in the Home page -- whereby they will be directed to a submissions page with a single-line input text field titled ‘School Name’, and 3 paragraph input textboxes titled: About, Location, and Admissions. The submission page should also have the ability to upload a single image. See image below.
- Upon hitting 'Submit', the user should be directed back to the Home page, whereby they will see the new school name appear, and a user can click on it to see the information displayed nicely.
- Once in the newly created page, the user should also have the ability to click on 'Update' to edit the text and image.
